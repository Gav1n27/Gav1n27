T H E SCHOOL 
HISTORY OF INFANT JESUS ACADEMY 
The Infant Jesus Academy (IJA) School System was established 
in response to a need for a co-educational school that offers excellent 
education to students of families of average means. It started as a small 
school in Marikina City offering classes for pre-school children and has 
expanded into a 3-campus school system that offers complete courses 
in basic education, including senior high school. 
THE MARIKINA CAMPUS 
In the late 1970’s, Mrs. Consolacion Florentino-Mallonga, 
together with her husband, Dr. Alberto T. Mallonga, established a school 
in Rancho Estate Subdivision, part of the growing suburbs of Marikina. 
Mrs. Mallonga was a respected educator in the community with more 
than 30 years of experience in teaching and administration while Dr. 
Mallonga was a physician who decided to retire from medical practice 
to concentrate on helping his wife with her new endeavor. The school 
that they established was envisioned as an alternative for families who 
could not afford to send their children to exclusive schools that were 
known to offer quality education but who desire a comparable, 
excellent schooling for them. In addition, the founders also wanted to 
inculcate in the students positive values that will help them become 
effective citizens of the country. Of particular interest to the founders of 
the school is the spiritual formation of the students in the Catholic faith, 
an objective that they pursued without prejudice to the admission of 
students who have different religious affiliations. The plan to put up this 
school was conceived in December, the Christmas Season of 1978, thus 
its name, Infant Jesus Academy, to honor the Holy Infant in the Manger. 
The IJA Marikina Campus has been steadily growing through the years, 
with its mother campus extending to two sub-campuses within its vicinity 
to accommodate students’ need for wider and better facilities. 
The Main Campus 
The main campus, IJA-Marikina, is located in the residential 
community of Rancho Estate, bounded by SSS Village in Marikina City. 
Formal school operations began in June 1979 with the opening of 
classes for 127 Pre-elementary pupils. The corporate entity responsible for 
The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition   5 
the management of the school system, Infant Jesus Academy Inc., was 
formally organized and registered as a non-stock, non-profit corporation 
in February 1980. The following academic year, classes for Grades 1-4 
started and the first batch of Grade 6 pupils graduated in March 1983. 
Government recognition for the Elementary Course was granted in the 
same year. 
Many parents requested the school to organize a High School 
Department, and so in June 1983 the IJA High School started its 
operations, with the government recognition granted in 1986. The first 
batch of High School graduates received their diplomas in 1987. 
The active involvement of the parents in the development of 
Infant Jesus Academy was evident since the school’s beginnings with 
the IJA Family Council (IJAFC), the association of parents, teachers and 
guardians of the IJA students, formally organized in 1980. Since then, the 
IJAFC had been a steadfast partner of the school administration in 
improving the school’s facilities and programs. 
The early 1990’s witnessed a rush of construction to improve the 
school’s instructional facilities in this campus. Its three-storey building that 
currently houses the classrooms and offices was completed in 1993. 
More land was acquired by the school in 1995 which enabled the 
administration to build the area which is now occupied by the 
computer laboratory, the HE laboratory and canteen. A four-storey 
structure which houses among others, the school chapel was 
renovated in 1999. To mark the school’s Silver Jubilee in 2004, its 
quadrangle was renovated and called the Jubilee Quadrangle. In 2006, 
its science laboratory was improved to enhance the Science 
instructional program. When the school celebrated its Pearl Anniversary 
in 2009, the school façade in the main campus was renovated to mark 
this event. 
The Molave (CFM) Campus  
6   The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition 
The year 2001 witnessed the opening of a separate Pre
elementary campus along Gen. Ordonez St., in Marikina Heights which 
was called the IJA-Molave campus (because Gen. Ordonez St. was 
originally called Molave St.). The attractive classrooms and play areas 
provide a stimulating learning environment for children. 
Between 2007 and 2008, the school was able to expand the IJA-Molave campus, and the decision to put up a Primary Level campus 
was made in 2009. In December of that year, the construction of the 
new IJA Primary building was started. The building was completed in 
October 2010 and was named Consolacion F. Mallonga Memorial 
(CFMM) Building to honor the memory of the IJA founder and Directress 
who passed on September 17, 2010. In November 2010, after the 
semestral break, the primary pupils started enjoying their newly 
constructed building, with classrooms equipped with television sets for 
the teachers’ technology integration and with built-in comfort rooms for 
primary boys’ and girls’ usage. 
The Ipil (ATM) Campus 
IJA was able to acquire another property close to the Molave 
Campus, along Ipil Street in Marikina Heights in December 2015. This 
move is in line with its commitment to continuously improve its facilities for 
existing and future students. This campus is intended to house the upper 
classmen of the High School and two levels of the Senior High School. 
This property has two existing buildings, which accommodate 
classrooms and laboratory facilities. In the early days of 2016, renovations 
of the two buildings started, and in July 2016 the first three classes of 
Grade 11 students moved in its building at the back (now called Building 
The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition   7 
B) while continuous renovations were being done in the front building 
(now called Building A). In June 2017, the campus was able to provide 
homerooms and facilities for the Grade 10, 11 and 12 students. Building 
A now houses, among others, the cafeteria, Physical and Biological 
Science Laboratories, Computer Laboratory and Library while Building B 
houses the faculty room and the home rooms of the students. This 
campus is called the ATM campus in honor of the other founder of the 
school, the late husband of Mrs. Consolacion F. Mallonga, Dr. Alberto T. 
Mallonga (ATM).  
To provide for the students’ increasing need for facilities, in 2017, 
the school acquired the property owned by the former Celestial Village 
Academy, which has ceased operations. It is a property adjacent to the 
ATM Building hence the name ATM Extension Building. Beginning School 
Year 2018-2019, it accommodated the grades 9 and 10 students. The 
acquisition of the ATM extension made room for the provision of an 
exhibition hall for visual arts (the Sentro Leona Art Center) and the faculty 
room in Building A and a multi-purpose hall at the third floor of Building B, 
as the cafeteria from the Building A was transferred to the extension 
building. 
The school’s founder, Mrs. Consolacion F. Mallonga was formerly 
a nun belonging to the Servants of the Holy Spirit congregation and so 
Catholic education was promoted in the school since its inception. 
Infant Jesus Academy was accepted as a member of the Catholic 
Education Association of the Philippines (CEAP) in 2006. In the same 
year, it underwent a certification program conducted by the Private 
Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) of the Department of 
Education (DepEd) thru its Fund for Assistance to Private Education 
(FAPE), which enable the school to secure tuition subsidy for its high 
school students under the Education Service Contracting (ESC) of the 
8   The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition 
Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education 
(GASTPE) program of the government. The school’s participation in this 
program provided a much needed financial assistance to many 
students.  
While continuously improving its facilities and services, the IJA 
system of schools always set as its utmost priority, the continuous 
development of its instructional programs by seeking accreditation from 
reputable accrediting organizations. In February 2005, the High School 
Department of IJA-Marikina was granted applicant status by the 
Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities 
(PAASCU), making it the first co-educational school in Marikina to 
receive such a status. In 2008, it became an accredited member school 
with a Level I status. Its Elementary or Grade School Department 
underwent the consultancy visit and the preliminary survey in 2009 and 
2010, respectively, and was granted applicant status in 2011. The year 
2012 marked another milestone for IJA as its High School Department 
received its Level II accredited status from the PAASCU, valid for five 
years, while its Grade School Department got the endorsement for 
formal visit from the same accrediting association. Consequently, in 
2013, the Grade School was given a Level I accreditation. IJA has 
relentlessly embraced its mission of advancing its programs and services 
by seeking consultancy and training from experts in education, both 
within the country and abroad. In 2016, IJA invited a team of consultants 
from the United States to train its teachers and personnel on the current 
trends in the teaching-learning process for 21stcentury learners. In the 
same year, IJA requested the PAASCU to revisit its Grade School which 
resulted in the Grade School being granted Level II Accredited Status 
with a five-year validity period. In December of 2017, the High School 
Department was awarded its Level II Re-Accredited Status, valid until 
November 2022. 
As IJA’s curricular programs steadily progress and as its status of 
being accredited gradually spreads, several foreign students started to 
express intent of enrolling and several even enrolled. Thus the school 
sought and was granted accreditation with the Bureau of Immigration in 
December 2018 for it to be authorized to admit foreign students and/or 
students born of Filipino parents abroad.  
The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition   9 
THE ANTIPOLO CAMPUS 
In December 1995, a new campus with an area of close to one 
hectare was built to serve the needs of students residing in Cogeo and 
the nearby areas in Antipolo City. In June of the following year, classes 
opened for 27 pupils from Grades 1-3. They were enrolled in classes that 
were considered extension for the Marikina campus. In June 1997, IJA
Antipolo formally operated as a separate campus. In the year 2000 it 
was granted government recognition for courses in the Pre-elementary 
and Elementary levels and in 2003 the Secondary level course was 
granted government recognition. The original building was expanded in 
1999 to accommodate the growing school population and to provide 
more facilities for the students. 
In 1997, the IJA Antipolo Family Council was organized. The 
IJAAFC had been a supportive presence in all the activities and 
programs of the school, conducting numerous fund-raising and training 
activities among the member parents. 
In 2006, this campus was certified by PEAC to be an ESC 
participating school, making it facilitate tuition subsidy grants from the 
government for its high school students. The desire to continuously 
improve the quality of the school’s educational services provided the 
impetus to seek accreditation from PAASCU for IJA-Antipolo. In October 
15 – 16, 2015, the school underwent preliminary accreditation visit and 
was granted an applicant status in December of the same year. In 2016, 
the school worked on its Level I accreditation and was granted such 
status in the same year, valid for three years.  
The improvement of the physical plant of the school is 
continuous. The construction of a covered court in June 2016 provided 
the much needed area for assemblies, programs and Physical 
10   The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition 
Education classes. Plans are also underway for the construction of 
additional classrooms and other facilities. 
THE KALIBO CAMPUS 
The school continued to grow with the establishment of IJA
Kalibo in 2003. Classes for about 35 Pre-elementary children were 
conducted in a rented building across the town plaza of Kalibo, Aklan. 
In December of the same year, negotiations for the acquisition of a half
hectare property were completed and the new IJA-Kalibo campus was 
built. The main building which houses classrooms and other academic 
facilities like the library and laboratories was named Dr. Alberto T. 
Mallonga Hall in honor of the school’s founding president. The school 
was granted government recognition in 2006 for complete courses in 
the pre-elementary, elementary and secondary levels. In the same year, 
this campus was certified by PEAC as an ESC participating school and in 
2009, it became a member of CEAP. The school has been serving as the 
testing center of the Ateneo de Manila University for its Ateneo College 
Entrance Test (ACET) since 2008. Likewise, the University of Santo Tomas 
(UST) has also established linkages with the school starting 2011 for its 
college admission test. IJA-Kalibo now serves as testing center in Aklan 
for the University of Santo Tomas Entrance Test (USTET). 
As in the case of the other IJA schools, the IJA Kalibo Family 
Council was immediately organized upon the school’s establishment in 
2003. The IJAKFC is actively engaged in activities and programs that 
benefit the entire IJA community. 
In 2011, a new building was constructed in the campus to 
address its growing population’s needs. This building bears the name of 
the beloved directress and founder of the IJA School System, Mrs. 
Consolacion F. Mallonga. 
The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition   11 
The years 2017 to 2019 marked important years in the IJA Kalibo 
history as it prepared for its accreditation from PAASCU. On its 15th year 
of service to the Kalibo community in 2018, it received the approval from 
PAASCU to proceed with its formal survey visit. Subsequently, in May 
2019, it was awarded accreditation (Level I), making it the first Basic 
Educational institution in Aklan to be granted accredited status. 
SYSTEM-WIDE CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT 
Today, the Infant Jesus Academy schools are recognized in the 
communities where they are located to be among the best 
educational institutions offering quality education. A distinct character of 
the IJA schools is their commitment to integrity, responsibility, excellence 
and discipline - values which serve as the foundation of all its policies 
and programs. A corps of dedicated and effective administrators is at 
the helm of the school’s operations. Forming the backbone are faculty 
members who are honed in the craft of molding young children into 
becoming effective life-long learners and responsible citizens. The IJA 
Faculty undergo yearly in-service training and benefit from the 
occasional lectures/demonstrations conducted by highly respected 
educators from local academic institutions and also educators from 
abroad. The administrators and faculty members are supported in their 
tasks by other school personnel who attend to the many needs of the 
learning community. 
Developments in information and communication technology 
had a positive impact in teaching and learning as well as administration 
at IJA. In 2006, the Marikina campus was able to automate the process 
of enrollment and issuing grades and other academic reports through 
the School Integrated Management System (SIMS) software that the 
12   The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition 
school commissioned to be developed. The same was done for 
administration tasks like cashiering and payroll preparations. The SIMS 
was adopted for use by the Antipolo campus in 2010. In all of its 
campuses, IJA teachers, students, administrators and the school staff are 
provided efficient access to the internet through broadband 
connections. Another milestone in the history of the school is the 
intensification of educational technology integration in instruction 
through the adoption of a learning management system and more 
extensive use of effective audio visual materials. All the classrooms of the 
three schools are equipped with big television screens, and the teachers 
extensively prepare and use audio visual materials in instruction using 
their laptops and other devices.  
The impacts of the on-going educational reforms in the country 
have also affected the school system. The past years have witnessed 
the continuous review and revision of the school’s curriculum to address 
the needs of 21st century learners and in preparation for the 
implementation of the Senior High School program. IJA strives to make 
the teaching-learning process more balanced, well-rounded and 
student-centered as it adopted several educational frameworks that 
help teachers prepare and facilitate lessons that would develop the 
students’ socio-emotional skills alongside their intellectual competencies. 
Together with that, the school also strengthened its advocacy for 
Positive Discipline as it continuously trains its personnel in the field of 
Positive Discipline for Everyday Teaching and Parenting. From 2015 to 
2017, three of its administrators have been trained by the Save the 
Children Organization to be official facilitators of teacher trainings for 
Positive Discipline. Within those years, the school became the first private 
school to be model of positive discipline in the National Capital Region 
and continues to be one up until these present days.  
In 2016, all the campuses of the school system opened its Senior 
The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition   13 
High School, offering the academic track with all the strands: Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM); Humanities and 
Social Sciences (HUMSS); Accounting, Business and Management 
(ABM); and General Academic Strand (GAS). The first batch of students 
in the Senior High School program graduated in March of 2018. 
In addition to the government-led educational reforms, another 
development that has created a felt impact on the IJA school system is 
the adoption by the CEAP of the Philippine Catholic Schools Standards 
(PCSS). In May of 2016, representatives of administrators, faculty 
members, staff, students, parents and alumni from the different 
campuses of IJA gathered to review the school’s vision and mission 
statements to determine adherence to the standards and benchmarks 
of PCSS. The vision and mission statements of the school were 
consequently revised. In addition, the school system’s five-year 
development plan for 2015-2020 was crafted using the PCSS as one of 
the references in setting goals and objectives.  
In more than four decades of promoting excellence, Infant 
Jesus Academy continuously seeks to improve its programs and facilities 
to be able to provide quality education and character formation for the 
students. The firm commitment of the members of the school 
community to pursue the school’s vision and mission provides the 
impetus for continued growth and development in the future years to 
come.  
14   The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition 
Promoting faith-enhanced quality education for 21st century learning  
Vision 
Infant Jesus Academy is an inclusive learning community inspired by a 
living faith in Christ as it nurtures learners to be God-loving patriotic 
Filipinos, imbued with the values of integrity, responsibility, excellence, 
and discipline.  
Mission 
We, the members of the Infant Jesus Academy community, promote life-long learning aimed at the holistic development of the human person - 
mind, body and spirit. We pursue a curriculum which fosters a culture of 
excellence through 21st century learning, strengthened by a desire to 
live our Christian faith and value our cultural heritage. 
We draw inspiration from the Infant Jesus in the Manger as we 
look forward with our people to a society where peace arising from 
justice reigns, where man takes responsibility for the wise stewardship of 
God’s creations, where Filipinos take pride and dignity in our national 
identity. He fills us with hope that by working towards the fulfillment of 
our vision, we shall be able to do our share in the realization of this 
dream.  
We endeavor to develop and strengthen the students’ faith 
and love in God, helping them to see themselves as members of a 
Christian community.  
We desire to instill in the students love for our country and 
cultivate their being Filipino in a global community of nations.  
We want them to be aware of humanity’s responsibility towards 
the conservation of the earth’s resources and the preservation of the 
environment. 
The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition   15 
We take every effort to prepare our students for tertiary 
education in the best universities and colleges. We believe that these 
institutions have the capability to develop the students’ abilities to their 
full potential, at the same time, strengthen in them the values that 
would propel them to take an active role in transforming the global 
society.  
We strive to develop in them a sense of integrity and self
discipline so that they are constantly guided by these words they have 
learned throughout their stay in IJA: “ Do the right thing, at the right time, 
in the right place with the right people.”  
We aspire to develop their sense of responsibility, helping them 
become aware of their rights, duties and obligations and fulfill these in 
whatever situation they find themselves in. 
We aim for the holistic development of the individual – 
physically fit, emotionally adjusted, academically outstanding, socially 
responsive, appreciative of the arts, and vocationally proficient. 
These, we hope to achieve in a learning process and 
environment that foster communication and collaboration, develop 
critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and promote effective and 
ethical use of information, media and technological resources.
 With our particular concern for children of working parents, we 
are committed to pursuing measures that will promote cooperation 
between the school and home in ensuring close attention to the 
personal welfare of the students. 
Lastly, in view of the present Philippine reality where quality 
education is accessible only to those belonging to the upper classes, we 
commit ourselves to helping children of average means obtain 
excellent education and will ensure educational and financial policies 
that will fulfill this commitment. 
16   The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition 
THE IJA EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES

THE IJA SEAL 
The IJA school seal features an escutcheon divided into four 
parts by a cross which symbolizes Jesus Christ who is the center of all the 
school’s undertakings. On the upper left is the image of the Holy Spirit, 
representing the source of inspiration of the school’s Founder, Mrs. 
Consolacion F. Mallonga who used to belong to the Servant Sisters of 
the Holy Spirit congregation. The image of the Holy Spirit also symbolizes 
that the members of the school community continuously seek guidance 
from Him in achieving the school’s vision and mission. The torch and 
The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition   35 
open book represent enlightenment and 
knowledge. At the lower right is the image of Infant 
Jesus in the Manger, the guiding light when the 
school was being constructed in December 1978. 
Two parts of the heraldic shield bear the school 
colors—blue and silver. Blue is associated with the 
Virgin Mary, peace and service. Silver symbolizes 
the enduring light that continuously sparks the 
school’s commitment to excellence and pursuit of 
relevant education for the youth. The 1979 on the 
curved edge of the escutcheon was the year 
when the first IJA School - IJA Marikina, opened its 
doors to students. The scroll below the escutcheon 
indicates the location of the campus and the year when it was 
established. 
The seal of Infant Jesus 
Academy serves as a 
constant reminder of 
what IJA stands for. 
THE IJA CORE VALUES 
At Infant Jesus Academy, the four core values that best define 
our community are Integrity, Responsibility, Excellence and Discipline 
(IRED). These values are the very foundation of all the school’s 
undertakings, and therefore the rules and regulations that students 
should follow will have to be based on these. It is an IJAian’s task to 
follow school rules and to trust that these are designed to strengthen in 
them the values that would propel them to take an active role in 
transforming the global society. 
Integrity 
The consistent strength to adhere to a code of moral reasoning 
in spite of the personal discomfort this might bring. IJAians must 
show moral strength and consistency in matters personal, 
academic, social, and athletic. 
Responsibility 
The quality of being morally or legally accountable, reliable and 
worthy of trust. We must hold no one but ourselves responsible for 
our own actions or inactions, as we know we are free to choose 
them. 
36   The IJA Student Handbook, 2019 Edition 
Excellence 
The expectation that all will learn, and strive to learn to the best 
of their abilities with barriers to learning recognized and addressed, 
opportunities to extend academic ability being provided along 
with creativity and individuality being nurtured. 
Discipline 
There is time for everything: a time for rising in the early morning, 
a time for prayer, a time for work, a time for a little rest and 
nourishment needed by the body, a time for silence, a time for 
relaxing. In a society of pleasure-seeking, of instant gratification of 
needs, an IJAian is trained to observe discipline in everything: 
academic discipline of doing the assigned tasks, the discipline of 
orderliness, the discipline of listening and other things. These many 
little details in the school life of the students are meant to help them 
grow to be responsible, well-rounded members of society. 
THE IJA CREED

right place, with the right people, and 
everything will turn out right.”

viewing, listening, speaking, reading and writing. Auditory and visual 
discrimination and comprehension are the viewing and listening skills 
enhanced in this area, while pronunciation and use of expressions and 
grammatical structures are developed as part of the learners’ speaking 
skills. These skills are strengthened through the speech festivals (where 
both prepared and extemporaneous speeches are delivered by

customary classroom activities. Vocabulary development, word 
recognition, comprehension and study skills are part of the reading skills 
which the school develops by introducing classical and contemporary 
literary works of both local and foreign authors. Penmanship, which is 
introduced in the Pre-School Level and further enhanced in Grades 1 to 
6 forms part of writing skills of the learners in addition to the skills in 
composing essays and other literary or non-literary articles (composition 
writing). In the High School Level, enrichment courses related to 
Communication Arts in English are also offered.  
Communication Arts in Filipino. Filipino as a separate area is introduced 
in Kinder. Its primary aim is to develop competencies in using the Filipino 
language in various communicative situations. It also aims to inculcate in 
the learner a sense of pride in one’s cultural heritage and Filipino identity. 
The development of the 5 macro skills of viewing, listening, 
speaking, reading and writing in this subject emphasizes enhancement 
of the critical thinking skills and communicative or interactive 
competence. These specific knowledge and skills are developed by 
introducing the students to materials such as themes, poems, jingles, 
stories, and dialogues suited to their level. These are further enhanced 
through the Timpalak Bigkasan done quarterly to augment the 
teacher’s regular classroom activities. 
In addition, some contents from Araling Panlipunan in the 
Primary and in the Intermediate Levels are used to develop the 
language skills. 
Science and Technology. Science education aims to help learners gain 
functional understanding of science concepts and principles that will 
eventually prepare them to be conscientious individuals who make 
sound judgments and decisions about real life situations (social, health or

human affairs. 
The IJA Science Education, which is offered as early as Nursery 
all the way up to high school, exposes the learners to the specific 
processes like observing, inferring, predicting and experimenting. Basic 
concepts about one’s health and ideas about the environment and its 
conservation also form part of this curriculum. It is further enhanced in 
the higher levels with the integration of technology and its wise and 
ethical use. Through the IJA science curriculum, the learner’s are 
expected to manifest deeper understanding of concepts that would 
eventually lead them to apply their learning in appropriate contexts in 
real life.

Nursery. The subject area specifically aims to develop the learners’ skills 
and/or processes of knowing and understanding, estimating, 
computing and solving, visualizing and modeling, representing and 
communicating, conjecturing, reasoning, proving and decision-making,

processes are developed through classic classroom activities 
augmented by the use of manipulative objects, measuring devices, 
calculators, computers and other forms of technology. In general, the 
IJA Math curriculum contributes to the fulfillment of one of IJA’s goals of

problem solving skills that will make them cope with the challenges of 
the 21st century.
